## ROADMAP
<!-- —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— -->

For each project file, Plan and progress.

#### All .cs files
- [x] Refactor structuring comments.
- [x] Add attributes, constructors, and methods from UML.
<!-- - [ ]  -->

#### 000_Program.cs
- [ ] Build out menu functionality (layered loops within switchcase structure).
    1. [ ] TopMenu: Level 1 (Actions)
        1. [ ] Create New Goal
        2. [ ] List Goals
        3. [ ] Save Goals

        1. [ ] Update username
        2. [ ] Delete account (perhaps name the goals.(txt/csv/json) file after the user and delete that file.)
    3. [ ] TopMenu: Level 3 (Quit)
        1. [ ] Add Logic: SaveGoals()

## FUNCTIONALITY
<!-- —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— -->

#### All .cs files

1. (coming...)

#### 000_Program.cs

1. (coming...)

#### 001_Goal.cs

1. Display the user's score
2. Allow the user to create new goals of any type.
3. Allow the user to record an event (meaning they have accomplished a goal and should receive points).
4. Show a list of the goals. This list should show indicate whether the goal has been completed or not (for example [ ] compared to [X]), and for checklist goals it should show how many times the goal has been completed (for example Completed 2/5 times).
    - Simple: [ ] --> [x]
    - Eternal: [ ] --> [streak / target]
    - Checklist: [ ]
5. Allow the user's goals and their current score to be saved and loaded.

#### 002_Simple.cs

1. Provide for simple goals that can be marked complete and the user gains some value.
    - For example, if you run a marathon you get 1000 points.

#### 003_Eternal.cs

1. Provide for eternal goals that are never complete, but each time the user records them, they gain some value.
    - For example, every time you read your scriptures you get 100 points.

#### 004_Checklist.cs

1. Provide for a checklist goal that must be accomplished a certain number of times to be complete. Each time the user records this goal they gain some value, but when they achieve the desired amount, they get an extra bonus.
    - For example, if you set a goal to attend the temple 10 times, you might get 50 points each time you go, and then a bonus of 500 points on the 10th time.

## IDEAS
<!-- —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— -->

#### Gamification

1. **Bonus points -** Play "what are the odds" with the user. They set range and make a guess and if a random number generator produces the same number they get a point bonus proportional to the "chance" of winning. This could run when they complete a Simple goal, meet the Checklist target, or complete a set interval of occurences of a specific Eternal goal.
